Issues related to conversion from asciidoc to sphinx

The main issues concern python code: how to best display
it and how to test it.

There are presently two main cases:

0. In overview.rst there is a python file that is brought in
via a

.. literalinclude::

This seems to me to be very simple: just test the examples directory.

1. Parameters.rst has many code snippets (as will many other).

1a. Minor thing: the student keeps using >>> for all lines and
    never ... but I'm not sure that is bad.

1b. Probably these snippet lines should be brought in from
a testable py file in the examples directory. So far as I know, in sphinx
one must reference lines by line number, which is fragile but can
be made to work.
