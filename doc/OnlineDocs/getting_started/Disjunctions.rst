Disjunctions
============

This is an advanced topic. 

A disjunction is a set of collections of variables, parameters, and constraints that are linked by an OR (really exclusive or) constraint. The simplest case is a 2-term disjunction:

D1 V D2

That is, either the constraints in the collection D1 are enforced, OR the constraints in the collection D2 are enforced.
