DLW March 2020 parmest to mpi-sppy
Scenario Creation Notes

Big picture:
- parmest wants to solve for Vars
- we are going to assume that these same vars are fixed
  by the scenario creation function, so
- a scenario is probability and a list of var names with corresponding values

Work plan (starting with semibatch)
0 start with scenarios directly from experiments
1 then add scenarios directly from bootstrap

notes
= I want to avoid requiring mpi-sppy for all parmest users, so
I think that just means builiding a "stand-alone" driver tool
that imports from parmest and mpi-sppy
--- or maybe, for now at least, just write a csv file
with one row per scenario: prob, var name, value, var name, value, ...

= to get started, do the semibatch example

= NOTE: parmest has a _pysp_instance_creation_callback but it is used internally

Thinking bigger:

= Does any of this have anything to do with Sirrola's ``Think about
a generic description of uncertain parameters and their relationship to
optimization models''



============================================
code notes:

1. scenarios from experiments:

- Create the object as in semibatch_parmest.py (call it parmest)
- loop over exp nums calling mode=_instance_creation_callback(exp num, cb_data)
   solve each model and grab the thetas
      for theta in parmest.theta_names:
          tvar = eval('model.'+theta)
	  tval = pyo.value(tvar)

2. scenarios from boostrap is already done: just write the bootstrap_theta df
